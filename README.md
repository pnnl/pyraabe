PyRaabe
=======
PyRaabe is a package to automate [Raabe table](http://mae.engr.ucdavis.edu/wexler/lungs/LF53-Raabe/text.pdf) generation from a triangulated surface of an airway geometry. It relies heavily on the [Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK)](http://www.vmtk.org/index.html) to extract a centerline from the 3D surface mesh and subsequently computes the relevant attributes for the Raabe table, including length, diameter, bifurcation angle, and gravity angle.

Installation
------------
Use [``conda``](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to create a virtual environment with required dependencies. First, ensure ``conda`` and ``anaconda-client`` are installed and updated:
```bash
conda install anaconda-client
conda update conda anaconda-client
```

Create the virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n pyraabe -c vmtk -c conda-forge python=3.6 itk vtk vmtk numpy scipy pandas
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```
conda activate pyraabe
```

Install PyRaabe using [``pip``](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
```bash
# clone/install
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/pyraabe.git
pip install pyraabe/

# direct
pip install git+https://github.com/pnnl/pyraabe
```

Usage:
------
Executing PyRaabe is quite simple. After installation, the command ``pyraabe`` will become available in your terminal. Usage overview is accessible via ``pyraabe --help`` or ``-h``, but all that needs to be supplied is a path to the input surface (.stl), a path to the desired output folder, and a gravity direction vector (below example represents -Y direction). The user may optionally supply the ``--extruded`` flag to signal that the inlet was artificially extruded for centerline computation, which voids computations for the first segment of the Raabe table. Note that the input surface must be open at the inlet and all outlets.
```bash
pyraabe input.stl output_dir/ --gravity 0 -1 0 --extruded
```
A VMTK window will appear; simply follow the onscreen instructions to identify inlet and outlets. Specifying the single inlet first will allow all outlets to be defined automatically when prompted. Both a centerline (.vtp) and Raabe table (.tsv) will be saved to the output directory.
